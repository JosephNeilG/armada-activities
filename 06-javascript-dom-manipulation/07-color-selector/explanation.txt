1. Click a color button. What happens?
- Clicking a button shows an alert that you clicked the button, followed by an alert again showing that you clicked the container.

2. Uncomment event.stopPropagation(); inside the button click handler.
3. Click a color button again. What changed?
- Clicking a button shows an alert again that you clicked the button, but now it does now show an alert that you clicked the container.

4. Explain in your own words why event.stopPropagation() is useful in this example.
- Based on my observation on how the event.stopPropagation() works in the example, it is useful when you both have a click event for a parent element and its child. It is used so that if you clicked a child, it won't count as a click for the parent. This way, only the child’s click event executes, preventing the parent’s event from running unintentionally.
