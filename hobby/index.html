        <h2>Why Running?</h2>
        <p>For me, running is more than just exerciseâ€”it's a way to clear my mind and feel more energized. Whether it's an early morning jog or a sunset run, it always gives me a sense of freedom and accomplishment.</p>
        <p>One of the things I love most about running is its flexibility. I can go at my own pace, explore new places, and challenge myself to run farther or faster.</p>
