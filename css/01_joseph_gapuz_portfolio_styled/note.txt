The assignment took me almost three hours to complete.

One of the challenges I faced was positioning elements properly and ensuring the page was responsive. I was able to resolve these issues by referring to the Flexbox cheatsheet (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and checking the HTML and CSS documentation on MDN Web Docs.

My favorite style that I added to the page was adopting the color theme of Armada Logics' LMS, which served as a great reference while designing. Another is the styling of the projects table that instead of using borders, I improved readability by adding a darker background to even-numbered rows and ensuring proper padding. The rounded corners were another detail I enjoyed implementing, as they gave the design a softer and less formal look. I also added a call-to-action buttons on the about page for users to have direct engagement points for them to easily navigate to contact me or redirect to my Linkedin.
